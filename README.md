# Maze-Solving-AI
This project involves designing and implementing a maze-solving AI capable of finding the shortest path using algorithms like A* (A-Star), Dijkstra's Algorithm, or Breadth-First Search (BFS). The AI will navigate a given maze to identify the optimal path from a start point to an endpoint, considering obstacles and potential dead ends.
